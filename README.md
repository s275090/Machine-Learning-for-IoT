# Machine-Learning-for-IoT-
The course aims to introduce the problems related to the implementation of machine learning applications and algorithms on platforms other than high-performance servers available in the cloud. Specifically, it introduces the main challenges which arise from the use of portable, low-power devices as the hosting node for the inference stages, showing which are the design and optimization techniques available today for App-Developers.  

This encompasses three main objectives: 
1. understand the IoT ecosystems, the IoT/sensor data and how to manage them, the characteristics of the compute architectures available at the edge; 
2. how to implement, train, and optimize inference engines that can be ported into a low-power micro-computer (e.g. a smartphone or an embedded sensor); 
3. how to let distributed inference nodes communicate each other and/or with a private server.

The course topics are organized in three main parts:
1. Internet-of-Things: HW and SW technologies, computer architectures used for running and developing "edge" machine learning algorithms, basic knowledge about sensors (sensing technologies, filtering, conversion), modeling and optimization of non-functional metrics (energy, performance).
2. Machine and Deep Learning in the IoT: Classification and taxonomy of ML/DL, industrial framework for model training and optimization, resource-driven model optimization.
3. Data exchange: Distributed software platforms for edge computing, management of edge-fog-cloud interfaces (web programming/network programming of IoT protocols - REST response and Publish subscribe and MQTT), Microservices design patterns, cloud/edge workload balancing.

Lab practices will touch upon the above topics, teaching students to implement their own optimization and communication applications using as benchmark real-life use-cases where IoT will be sampled, pre-processed, distilled and communicated with a dedicated server node.
